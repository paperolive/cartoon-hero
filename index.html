		<h2>Who is Ahsoka Tano?</h2>
			<img src="img/who-tano.jpeg">
			<p>Ahsoka Tano was fourteen when she was assigned as a padawan to Jedi Knight and Commander of the GAR Anakin Skywalker. The young togruta joined her new teacher in the midst of a campaign to retake Christophsis, arriving as ordered by the Jedi Council (who had not seen fit to notify Skywalker beforehand). Despite his initial reluctance to taking on a student in the middle of war and as a very young and very new knight, Anakin warmed to Ahsoka quickly as she showed tenacity and bravery and a certain likeness of spirit. </p>

			<p>Taught by not only Skywalker, but also Kenobi, Rex, the entire 501st and sometimes the 212th, Ahsoka learned quickly in the high-risk environment. As she honed her skills with the Force and her dual-wielding lightsaber forms, the wartime padawan also grew into her role as Commander with a keen mind and a great deal of heart.</p>
